# HoneyVox Ad-Lib FX

Vintage-inspired vocal effects VST3 plugin by Nolo's Addiction.

## Features

- **PHONE** - Three drastically different eras:
  - **Rotary** (1920s-50s): Extreme narrow bandwidth, carbon mic character
  - **Touch-Tone** (1960s-80s): Classic landline sound
  - **Mobile** (1990s-2000s): GSM codec robotic character

- **DELAY** - With TIME, FEEDBACK, MIX controls + Ping-Pong mode

- **HONEY** - HG-2 style saturation with:
  - Pentode stage (odd harmonics, aggression)
  - Triode stage (even harmonics, warmth)
  - Transformer stage (compression, coloration)

- **UNDERWATER** - Muffled low-pass with resonance

## Setup

1. Put your PNGs in the `Resources` folder:
   - `logo.png` - Your logo artwork
   - `knob.png` - Vertical filmstrip (optional)

2. Open `HoneyVoxFX.jucer` in Projucer

3. Set JUCE paths and build

## Knob Filmstrip Format

If using a custom knob, create a vertical PNG with frames stacked:
- Each frame should be square (e.g., 100x100)
- Stack frames vertically (e.g., 128 frames = 100x12800)
